- constructor is executed automatically when a new object is created
- constructor is used to initialize object properties

-> Class Inheritance
- "extends" keyword use to create a class inheritance.
- Class inheritance inherits all the methods from parent's class
- The super() method refers to the parent class.
- By calling the super() method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor.
