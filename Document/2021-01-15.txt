==============JS==============
-> Object
- In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.
- All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.
- Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.
- var x = person;
- Above statement, Both x and person are the same object.
- Any changes to x will also change person, because x and person are the same object.


-> Primitive value
- 5 types of primitive data types:
- string, number, boolean, null, undefined


-> Prototype Inheritance
- All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
- prototype property allows us to add new properties to object constructors.

-> First class Function
- JS treats function as objects.
- In js we can store function in object, vriable & array.
- JS allow us to pass functions as parameter to another function and return functions from other functions.
